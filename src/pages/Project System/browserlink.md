## JavaScript and Web Sockets
Browser Link is a bi-directional communication channel between Visual
Studio and any browser or emulator. It's based on JavaScript and 
Web Sockets.

This channel allows messages and commands to be sent from Visual Studio
to the browser, such as to reload the page or update the CSS rules.

But it can also work the other way so that the browsers can interact
with Visual Studio.
