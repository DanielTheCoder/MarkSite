## Basic auto-completion
The always-up-to-date web standards in Visual Studio provides a
fast and precise auto-completion experience.

## Advanced auto-completion
The Intellisense engine provides accurate auto-completion for
classes, IDs and attribute names and values, which can sometimes
be hard to remember.

## Vendor specific properties
The vendor specific selectors and properties are hidden until you
type a hyphen. Vendor specific definitions are supported for `-moz-*`, 
`-ms-*`, `-o-*` and `-webkit-*`.

and a lot more.

## Working with colors
The color picker is part of Intellisense which makes it very handy to
use whenever you're dealing with colors. Use the eyedropper to pick
colors from other windows, set the opacity or chose from previously
used colors.

## File picker
Working with images, fonts and other files is very easy using
the built-in file picker that automatically helps you type file
paths in CSS documents.

## Hierarchical indentation
Keep your CSS file nice and organized using hierarchical indentation.

The indentation of the CSS rulesets are based on the cascading order
of the selectors. Just format the document using `Ctrl+K+D` to
hierarchical indent cascading rulesets.
