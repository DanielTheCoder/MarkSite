## Variables
Quickly access your variable from the current document or any imported
files. The tooltip shows the value of each variable so you don't have
to guess.

## Mixins
The editor provides both Intellisense and tooltips for mixins in the
same file as well as across imported files.

## Go to definition
Easily jump between Mixins and variable references using `F12` to go to 
the definition. This works for any references even across multiple files
and imports.
