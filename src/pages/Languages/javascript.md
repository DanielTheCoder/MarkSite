## Basic auto-completion
The JavaScript Intellisense engine is powered by Internet Explorer's JavaScript
execution engine, Chakra. 

That means that all your JavaScript code is executed in the background to 
provide the ultimate Intellisense experience.

## EcmaScript 5 and 6 support
coming soon...

## Object literal Intellisense
The Chakra execution engine is capable of reverse engineering function
parameters to provide object literal Intellisense.

## JSDoc support

as the older [XMLDoc comment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb514138.aspx) 
syntax.
